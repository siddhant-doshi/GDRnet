# Drug_repurposing

We design a generic graph neural network (GNN) based drug repurposing model, called Dr-COVID.

Database used - DRKG - https://github.com/gnn4dr/DRKG

Covid_clinical_drugs - List of drugs in clinical trials for COVID-19 as per ICTRP (https://www.who.int/ictrp/).

Using_our_model - A demo of how we can predict drugs for diseases with Dr-COVID.
